For this Java Project our group made a Racecar Game. Cars travel around a track by following there specific route of checkpoints and are timed on their ability to cross the finish line and win the race.
In this project for this game we created a design in which included a GUI, many object oriented classes for the components of the Raceing Game(car, track, stop), and also class for the logic of the game.
