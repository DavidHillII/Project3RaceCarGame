For this Java Project, our group made a Racecar Game as instructed. Cars travel around a track by following their specific route of checkpoints and are timed on their ability to cross the finish line and win the race.
In this project for the game, we created a design that included a GUI, many object oriented classes for the components of the racing game (car, track, stop), and a class for the logic of the game. 
We also have attached the UML Design we made for this project as well as the pngs for the cars.
